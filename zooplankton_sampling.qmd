# Analysis of Numerical Plankton Images

## Zooplankton sampling

Zooplankton sampling is carried out using plankton net hauls....

## Image analysis

The collected organisms are then analysed by image analysis....

The resulting images named vignettes of each particle are studied.

....

## Training set

This guide allows you to develop a training set using all the vignettes obtained.
