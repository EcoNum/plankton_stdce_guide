# Level 2 : advanced classification

```{r,echo=FALSE}
source("R/init.R")
```

This advanced classification is based on the general level 3 classification proposed in this guide. Some knowledge of biology is required to effectively classify vignettes into the ... groups proposed.

## Plankton_crustacea

```{r}
vigns <- fs::dir_ls(
  here::here(training_dir, "Plankton_crustacea"), 
  type = "file", glob = "*.png", recurse = TRUE)
```

Within the plankton_crustacea group, it is possible to differentiate between gymnoplea, podoplea, Brachiopoda, malacostrace and ostracoda.

### Gymnoplea

Gymnoplea are copepods, which are a well-studied class of crustaceans. These copepods have antennules longer than the cephalosome and the urosome smaller than the prosoma. The calanoida below shows these morphological features (@fig-gymnoplea).

@fig-vig-gymnoplea shows a set of individuals in this group.

```{r}
#| label: "fig-vig-gymnoplea"
#| fig-cap: "Vignettes of Gymnoplea"
plot_vignettes(vigns, group = "Gymnoplea", nx = 5, ny = 5)
```

More details on this suborder of copepods can be found in the @sec-gymnoplea.

### Podoplea

Podoplea is composed by the order of cyclopoida and the order of Harpacticoida. These organisms have a great morphological diversity. The antennules are not longer than the prosome and urosome. The urosome is as long as the prosome or not clearly distinguished from the prosome

```{r}
#| label: "fig-vig-podoplea"
#| fig-cap: "Vignettes of Podoplea"
plot_vignettes(vigns, group = "Podoplea", nx = 5, ny = 5)
```

More details on this suborder of copepods can be found in the @sec-podoplea.

### Brachiopoda

```{r}
#| label: "fig-vig-brachiopoda"
#| fig-cap: "Vignettes of Brachiopoda"
plot_vignettes(vigns, group = "Branchiopoda", nx = 4, ny = 3)
```

### Malacostraca

```{r}
#| label: "fig-vig-malacostraca"
#| fig-cap: "Vignettes of malacostraca"
plot_vignettes(vigns, group = "Malacostraca", nx = 5, ny = 5)
```
