# Level 2 : advanced classification

```{r,echo=FALSE}
source("R/init.R")
```

This advanced classification is based on the general level 3 classification proposed in this guide. Some knowledge of biology is required to effectively classify vignettes into the ... groups proposed.

## Plankton_crustacea

```{r}
vigns <- fs::dir_ls(
  here::here(training_dir, "Plankton_crustacea"), 
  type = "file", glob = "*.png", recurse = TRUE)
```

The group plankton_crustacea includes the crustaceans. Typical organisms in this group are copepods, krill, crabs, shrimps, gammarids

Within the plankton_crustacea group, it is possible to differentiate between gymnoplea, podoplea, branchiopoda and malacostraca.

### Gymnoplea

Gymnoplea are copepods, which are a well-studied class of crustaceans. These copepods have antennules longer than the cephalosome and the urosome smaller than the prosoma. The calanoida below shows these morphological features (@fig-gymnoplea).

@fig-vig-gymnoplea shows a set of individuals in this group.

```{r}
#| label: "fig-vig-gymnoplea"
#| fig-cap: "Vignettes of Gymnoplea"
plot_vignettes(vigns, group = "Gymnoplea", nx = 5, ny = 5)
```

More details on this suborder of copepods can be found in the @sec-gymnoplea.

### Podoplea

Podoplea is composed by the order of cyclopoida and the order of Harpacticoida. These organisms have a great morphological diversity. The antennules are not longer than the prosome and urosome. The urosome is as long as the prosome or not clearly distinguished from the prosome. A copepod that does not look like a gymnoplea belongs to the podoplea.

```{r}
#| label: "fig-vig-podoplea"
#| fig-cap: "Vignettes of Podoplea"
plot_vignettes(vigns, group = "Podoplea", nx = 5, ny = 5)
```

More details on this suborder of copepods can be found in the @sec-podoplea.

### Branchiopoda

Among the branchiopoda are the Evadne (@sec-evadne) and podon (@sec-podon). These small crustaceans have a very clear shells on the vignettes

```{r}
#| label: "fig-vig-branchiopoda"
#| fig-cap: "Vignettes of Branchiopoda"
plot_vignettes(vigns, group = "Branchiopoda", nx = 4, ny = 3)
```

### Malacostraca

Among the malacostraca are the decapods (crabs, lobsters, shrimps,...), the euphausiids (krill), the amphipods (gammarids), the isopods and the stomatopods (the mantis shrimps). This group of crustaceans corresponds to the main idea that novices have of crustaceans (@fig-vig-malacostraca).

```{r}
#| label: "fig-vig-malacostraca"
#| fig-cap: "Vignettes of malacostraca"
plot_vignettes(vigns, group = "Malacostraca", nx = 5, ny = 5)
```

More details on class of Malacostraca can be found in the @sec-malacostraca.

## Plankton_dark

The plankton_dark group includes darkened organisms in the vignettes. This group consists of molluscs (bivalves and gastropods), annelids and actinopterygians (fish larvae).

```{r}
vigns <- fs::dir_ls(
  here::here(training_dir, "Plankton_dark"), 
  type = "file", glob = "*.png", recurse = TRUE)
```

### Mollusca

This group includes the bivalvia and gastropoda. All the organisms studied have shells ( @fig-vig-mollusca ).

Cavoliniidae and creseis are easily recognisable individuals among molluscs

```{r}
#| label: "fig-vig-mollusca"
#| fig-cap: "Vignettes of Mollusca"
plot_vignettes(vigns, group = "Mollusca", nx = 4, ny = 4)
```

More details on this phylum of mollusca can be found in the @sec-mollusca.

### Annelida

This group includes worms. Annelida are vermiform and metamerised body in several segments along a longitudinal axis ( @fig-vig-annelida ). Polychaetes are mainly found in the marine environment

```{r}
#| label: "fig-vig-annelida"
#| fig-cap: "Vignettes of Annelida"
plot_vignettes(vigns, group = "Annelida", nx = 3, ny = 3)
```

### Actinopterygii (fish larvae)

This group includes fish larvae. These vertebrates are easily identifiable. This group includes fish larvae. These vertebrates are easily identifiable. The most detailed level of the proposed classification allows differentiation between the different developmental stages of the organisms.

```{r}
#| label: "fig-vig-actinopterygii"
#| fig-cap: "Vignettes of Actinopterygii"
plot_vignettes(vigns, group = "Actinopterygii", nx = 4, ny = 5
)
```
